# TypeFX
Tired of your boring print statement? Use TypeFX instead to produce a typing effect whenever you want to print something in python.

## Syntax:
t(txt, time)

'txt' is the text you want to write

'time' controls how slow it writes

->The higher the time the slower the text writes out

->Has a default value if you do not pass an argument for it  

## Example:
```
t("Hi how is your day?", 0.03)
```

Or

```
t("Hi how is your day?")
```
