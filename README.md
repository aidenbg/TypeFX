# TypeFX
Tired of your boring print statement? Use TypeFX instead to produce a typing effect whenever you want to print a string in python.

Syntax:
t(txt, time)

txt is the text you wanna write

time controls how fast it writes

  -The higher the time the slower it writes out

  -Has a default value if you do not pass an argument for it  

Example

>t("Hi how is your day?", 0.03)

Or

>t("Hi how is your day?")
